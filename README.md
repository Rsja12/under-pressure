**Under Pressure**
---------
This is my first Rails project while going through Flatiron School's software engineering program. It's an application where users can create an account or register using their Google credentials. It allows users to log their scuba dives so that they can keep track of them and review each dive's details.

**Motivation**
---------
 The motivation behind this project came from wanting to create an application that allowed me to have all of my logged dives in one place and not scattered around different log books.

**Tech Used**
---------
Rails | OAuth | devise gem

**Installation**
---------
To get started, clone this project to your machine and cd into `under-pressure`. In the terminal run `rails db:migrate`. Afterwards start up a rails server with `rails s`. In your browser, head over to the address where your rails server is running.
